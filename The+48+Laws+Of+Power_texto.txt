hungry,tobeovert withyour powermoves. wehave toseem fairand decent. soweneed tobesubtlecongenial yetcunning, democratic yetdevious. thisgameofconstant duplicitymost resembles thepower dynamic that existed inthescheming world oftheoldaristocratic court. throughout history,acourt hasalwaysformed itself around thepersoninpowerking, queen, emperor,leader. the courtiers who filled this court were inanespe- ciallydelicate position: theyhad toserve their masters, butiftheyseemed tofawn, iftheycurried favor tooobviously,theother courtiers around them would notice and would actagainst them. attemptstowin the mas- ters favor, then, had tobesubtle. and even skilled courtiers capable of such subtletystill had toprotect themselves from their fellow courtiers, who atallmoments wereschemingtopushthem aside. meanwhile the court wassupposedtorepresenttheheight ofciviliza- tion and refinement. violent orovertpowermoves were frownedupon; couniers would work silentlyandsecretly against any amongthem who used force. this was the couxtiers dilemma: while appearingthevery paragon ofelegance, they had tooutwit and thwart their own opponentsin thesubtlest ofways. the successful comtier learned over time tomake all ofhis moves indirect; ifhestabbed anopponent intheback, itwaswith a velvet gloveonhishand and the sweetest ofsmiles onhisface. instead of usingcoercion oroutright treachery,theperfectcourtier gothisway through seduction, charm, deception,and subtle strategy, always planning several moves ahead. life inthe court was anever-ending gamethat re- quired constant vigilanceand tactical thinking.itwas civilized war. todayweface apeculiarlysimilar paradox tothat ofthe courtier: everythingmustappear civilized, decent, democratic, and fair. butifwe playbythose

with music commissioned byfouquetto honor theking. after dinner there was apromenade throughthechateaus gardens. thegrounds and fountains ofvauxlevicomte were tobetheinspiration forversailles. fouquet

found guiltyand sent tothe most isolated prisoninfrance, highinthe pyrenees mountains, where hespentthelasttwenty yearsofhislifeinsoli- taryconfinement. interpretation louis xiv, thesunking,was aproud andarrogantman who wanted tobe the center ofattention atalltimes; hecould not countenance beingout- done inlavishness byanyone,andcertainlynot hisfinance minister. to succeed fouquet,louis chose

popularity, makinghimindispensable totheking anddemonstratingthat hewould make anexcellent prime minister. instead, however, each new spectacle,each appreciativesmile bestowed bytheguestsonfouquet, made itseem tolouis that his own friends and subjectswere more charmed bythefinance minister thanbytheking himself, andthatfouquet wasactually flauminghiswealth and power.rather than flattering louis

such isthefate, insome form orother, ofallthose who unbalance the masters sense ofself,pokeholes inhisvanity,ormake him doubt hispro eminence. when thewming began, fouquetwas attheto:oftheworld. bythetime ithad ended, hewas atthebottom. voltaire, 16.944 778 observance ofthe law intheearly 1600s, theitalian astronomer and mathematician galileo found himself inaprecarious

ofthetime. once, forinstance, hepresentedamilitaiy compasshehad invented totheduke ofgonzaga. then hededicated a book explainingthe useofthecompass tothemedicis. both rulers were grateful, andthroughthem galileo was able tofind more students toteach. nomatter how greatthediscovery, however, hispatrons usually paidhim withgifts,notcash. this made for alifeofconstant insecurityanddepen- dence. there must beaneasierway,hethought. galileo hiton anew strategyinl6l0, when hediscovered the moons ofjupiter.instead ofdividing thediscovery among hispatronsgiving onethetelescopehehadused, dedicatingabook toanother, and soonas hehaddone inthepast,hedecided tofocus exclusivelyonthemedicis. he chose themedicis for one reason: shortlyafter cosimo ihad established themedici dynasty,in1540, hehad made jupiter,themightiestofthe gods, themedici symbola symbol ofa.powerthat went beyond politics andbanking,onelinked toancient rome and itsdivinities. galileo turned hisdiscovery ofupitersmoons into acosmic event law 133 -1 ,lawhonoring themedicis greatness. shortlyafter thediscovery,heannounced that thebrightstars the moons ofjupiterl offered themselves intheheav ens tohistelescopeatthe same time ascosimo iisenthronement. he said that thenumber ofthemoons--fourharmonized with thenumber of themedicis cosimo iihad three brothers and that the moons orbitecl jupiterasthese four sons revolved around cosimo i,thedynastysfounder. more than coincidence, thisshowed that theheavens themselves reflected theascendancy ofthemedici family.after hededicated thediscoveryto themedicis, galileo commissioned anemblem representing jupiter sitting on acloud with thefour stars circling about him, andpresentedthis to cosimo iiasasymbolofhislink tothe stars. in1610 cosimo iimade galileo hisofficial court philosopherand mathematician, with afullsalary.for ascientist this was thecoup ofalife time. thedays ofbegging forpatronagewere over. interpretation inonestroke, galileo gainedmore with his newstrategythan hehad in yearsofbegging. the reason issimple:all masters want toappearmore brilliant than other people. they donot care about science orempirical tmth orthelatest inven tion; theycare about their name and their glory.galileogavethemedicis infinitelymore glory bylinking their name with cosmic forces them hehad bymaking them thepatrons ofsome new scientific gadgetordiscovery. scientists arenotsparedthevagaries ofcourt lifeandpatronage. they too must serve masters who hold thepurse strings.and their great intellec- tualpowerscan make the master

also more important than theworkpro duoed inhis name. instead ofinsecurity youmust give himglory.galileo did notchallengetheintellectual authorityofthemedicis with hisdiscov ery,ormake them feel inferior inany way; byliterally aligningthem with thestars, hemade them shine brilliantly amongthe courts ofitaly. hedid notoutshine themaster, hemade themaster outshine allothers. keys to power everyonehas insecurities. whenyoushow yourselfintheworld and dis- play your talents, younaturallystirupallkinds ofresentment, envy,and other manifestations ofinsecurity. this istobeexpected.you cannot spend your lifeworrying about thepetty feelings ofothers. with those above you, however, youmust take adifferent approach: when itcomes topower, outshiningthemaster isperhapstheworst mistake ofall. donotfoolyourselfintothinkingthat lifehaschanged much since the daysoflouis xiv and themedicis. those who attain high standinginlife arelikekingsandqueens: theywant tofeel secure intheir positions,and superiortothose around them inintelligence, wit, and charm. itisa.deadly but common misperception tobelieve thatbydisplayingand vaunting your gifts andtalents, youarewinning themasters affection. hemay feign appreciation, but athisfirstopportunityhewillreplace you with someone lessintelligent, lessattractive, lessthreatening, justaslouis xiv replaced thesparkling fouquetwith thebland colbert. and aswith louis, hewill notadmit thetmth, butwillfind anexcuse toridhimself ofyour presence. this law involves tworules thatyoumust realize, first, youcan inad- vertently outshine amaster simply bybeing yourself. there are masters who are more insecure than others, nronstrously insecure; you maynatu- rallyoutshine them byyourcharm andgrace. no one had more natural talents than astorre manfredi, prince of faenza. the most handsome ofalltheyoung princes ofitaly, hecaptivated hissubjects with hisgenerosity and open spirit. intheyear 1500, cesare borgialaid siege tofaenza. when thecity surrendered, thecitizens expectedthe worst from thecruel borgia, who, however, decided tospare thetown: hesimply occupieditsfortress, exe- cuted none ofitscitizens, and allowed prince manfredi, eighteenatthe time, toremain with hiscourt, incompletefreedom. afew weeks later, though, soldiers hauled astorre manfrediawaytoa roman prison.ayearafter that, hisbodywas fished outofthe river tiber, astone tied around hisneck. borgia justifiedthehorrible deed with some sort oftmmpedup charge oftreason andconspiracy,but thereal problemwas that hewasnotoriouslyvain and insecure. theyoungman wasoutshininghim without even trying. given manfredis natural talents, theprincesmerepresencemade borgiaseem less attractive and charis- matic. the lesson issimple: ifyoucannot help being charmingandsupe not, youmust learn toavoid sud: monsters ofvanity. either that, orfind a waytomuteyour good qualitieswhen inthecompany ofacesare borgia. second, never imaginethat because the master lovesyou, youcan do anything youwant. entire books could bewritten about favorites who fell outoffavor bytakingtheir status forgranted,fordaringtooutshine. in late-sixteentbcenturyjapan,thefavorite ofemperor hideyoshiwas aman called sen norikyu.thepremierartist ofthe teaceremony,which had be- come anobsession with thenobility,he was one ofhideyoshismost trusted advisers, had his own apartmentinthepalace,and was honored throughout japan.yetin1591, hideyoshihad him arrested and sentenced todeath. rikyutook hisown life, instead. the cause forhissudden change offortune was discovered later: itseems thatrikyu, former peasantand later court favorite, had had awooden statue made ofhimself wearingsan- dals asign ofnobilityandposing loftily.hehad had this statue placedin themost important templeinside thepalace gates,inclear sight oftheroy- altywho often wouldpass by.tohidcyoshithissignifiedthatrikyuhad no sense oflimits. presurning that hehad the same rightsasthose ofthe highest nobility,hehadforgottenthat hisposition dependedonthe em peror,and had come tobelieve that hehad earned itonhis own. this was law 1 6 law 1anunforgivable miscalculation ofhis own importanceand hepaid forit with hislife. remember thefollowing:never take your position for granted and never letanyfavorsyoureceive gotoyourhead. knowingthedangers ofoutshining your master, youcan turn thislaw toyour advantage. first youmust flatter andpuff upyourmaster. overt flatterycan beeffective but has itslimits; itistoodirect andobvious, and looks bad toother courtiers. discreet flatteryismuch more

prussians wanted war atthat moment andmistakenlybelieved that theirarmywassuperior totheaustrians. had heplayed uptotheking, askingtobemade aminister inexchange forsupporting peace,hewould not have

inthefirsthalf ofthefifthcenturyb.c. hewon many impor- tantbattles, savingthecityfrom calamitytime and timeagain.because he spentmost ofhistime onthebattlefield, fewromans knew himpersonally, makinghimsomething ofalegendary figure. in454 b.c., coriolanus decided itwas time toexploithisreputation and enter politics. hestood forelection tothehigh rank ofconsul. candi dates forthisposition traditionally made apublicaddress early inthe race, and when coriolanus came before thepeople,hebegan bydisplaying the dozens ofscars hehad accumulated over seventeen years offighting for rome. few inthecrowd really heard thelengthy speech that followed; those scars, proof ofhisvalor andpatriotism, moved thepeopletotears. coriola.nuss election seemed certain. when thepolling day arrived, however, coriolanus made anentry into theforum escorted bytheentire senate andbythecitys patricians,the aristocracy. the common peoplewho saw this were disturbed bysuch a blusteringshow ofconfidence onelection day. and then coriolanus spoke again, mostly addressingthewealthyciti- zens who hadaccompanied him. hiswords were arrogantand insolent. claimingcertain victoryinthevote, heboasted ofhisbattlefield exploits, made sourjokesthatappealed onlytothepatricians,voiced angryaccuser tions against hisopponents, andspeculatedontheriches hewould bringto rome. this time thepeople listened: theyhad notrealized that thisleg- endary soldier was also acommon braggart. news ofcoriolanuss second speech spread quickly through rome, and thepeopleturned out ingreat numbers tomake sure he was not elected. defeated, coriolanus returned tothebattlefield, bitter andvowing revengeonthe common folk who hadvoted against him. some weeks later alarge shipmentofgrain arrived inrome. the senate wasreadytodistrib utethisfood tothepeople,forfree, butjustastheywere preparingtovote onthequestion coriolanus appearedonthe scene and took the senate floor. the distribution, heargued, would have a.harmful effect onthecity asawhole. several senators appearedwon over, and thevote onthedistri- bution fellinto doubt. coiiolanus did notstop there: hewent ontocon demo theconceptofdemocracyitself. headvocated getting ridofthe peoples represen!ativesthetribunes--and turningover thegoverningof thecitytothepatricians. when word ofcoriolanuss latest speech reached thepeople,their anger knew nobounds. the tribunes were sent tothe senate todemand that coriolanusappearbefore them. herefused. riots broke outallover thecity. the senate, fearingthepeoples wrath, finally voted infavor ofthe grain distribution. the tribunes were appeased,but thepeoplestilldo manded that coriolanus speaktothem andapologize. ifherepented, and agreedtokeephisopinionstohimself, hewould beallowed toreturn to thebattlefield. coriolanus didappearone lasttime before thepeople, who listened to him inraptsilence. hestarted slowly andsoftly,but asthespeechwent on, hebecame more and more blunt. yetagainhehurled insults! his tone was arrogant,hisexpressiondisdainful. the more hespoke,theangtier the peoplebecame. finally theyshouted him down and silenced him. the tribunes conferred, condemned coriolanus todeath, and ordered themagistratestotake him atonce tothetopofthetitrpeianrock and throw him over. the delighted crowd seconded thedecision. the patri- cians, however, managedtointervene, and the sentence was commuted to alifelong banishment. when thepeoplefound outthat romes great mili- tary hero would never retum tothecity, they celebrated inthe streets. in fact no one had ever seen web acelebration, not even after thedefeat ofa foreign enemy. interpretation before hisentrance intopolitics,the name ofcoriolanus evoked awe. hisbattlefield accomplishmentsshowed him asaman ofgreat brav- ery.since thecitizens knew little about him, allkinds oflegendsbecame at- tached tohis name. the moment heappearedbefore theroman citizens, however, andspokehismind, allthatgrandeur andmysteryvanished. he braggedand blustered like acommon soldier. heinsulted and slandered people,asifhefeltthreatened and insecure. suddenlyhe was not atall what thepeoplehadimagined.the discrepancybetween thelegend and thereality proved immensely disappointingtothose who wanted tobe lieve intheir hero. the more coriolanus said, the lesspowerfulheap- peared-a person who cannot control hiswords shows that hecannot control himself, and isunworthy ofrespect. had coriolanus said less, thepeoplewould never have had cause to beoffended byhim, would never have known histruefeelings.

proachedbamum inthe street. instead ofgiving himmoney,bamum de- cided toemploy him. taking him back tothe museum, hegave the man livebricks andtold him tomake aslow circuit ofseveral blocks. atcertain pointshe was tolaydown abrick onthesidewalk, always keepingone brick inhand. onthe return journeyhe was toreplaceeach brick onthe street with the one heheld. meanwhile hewas toremain serious ofcounte- nance and toanswer noquestions. once back atthe museum, he was to enter, walk around inside, then leave through theback door and make the same bricklayingcircuit again. on themans first walk throughthestreets, several hundred people watched hismysterious movements. byhis fourth circuit, onlookers swarmed around him, debating what hewasdoing. everytime heentered the museum hewas followed

curious, and those who hadalreadyseen her paidtoseeheragain, tofind outwhether the rumor that she was arobot was true. in1842, barnumpurchasedthe carcass ofwhat waspurported tobea mermaid. this creature resembled amonkeywith thebody ofafish, but the head andbodywere perfectly joineditwastrulyawonder. after some research barnum discovered that the creature had been expertly put together

ofpaintings showingmermaids. bythetime heshowed thespecimeninhismuseum, anational debate had beensparkedover the existence ofthese mythicalcreatures. afewmonths before batnums cam paign,no one had cared oreven known about mermaids; noweveryone wastalkingabout them asiftheywere real. crowds flocked inrecord num bers toseethefijimermaid, and tohear debates onthesubject. afewyears later, barnum toured europe with general tom thumb. a five-yearolddwarf from connecticut whom bamum claimed was an elevenvyear-old english boy, and whom hehad trained todomanyre- markable acts. during this tour bamums name attracted such attention thatqueen victoria, thatparagonofsobriety, requestedaprivateaudience with him and histalented dwarf atbuckingham palace. theenglish press mayhave ridiculed bamum, butvictoria wasroyally entertained byhim, andrespected him ever after. interpretation barnum understood the fundamental truth aboutattractingattention: once peoples eyesare onyou, youhave aspecial

sooneveryoneknew thedam:ers name: mata han. early thatyear,inthewinter, small and select audiences would gather in asalon filled with indian statues and other relics while anorchestra playedmusic inspired byhindu andjavanese melodies. after keepingthe audience waitingandwondering, mata hari would suddenly appear,ina startling costume: awhite cotton brassiere covered with india.ntype jewels; jeweledbands atthewaist supportingasarong that revealed asmuch asit concealed; braceletsupthe arms. then mata hari would dance, inastyle nooneinfrance had seen before, herwhole body swayingasifshe were in atrance. she told her excited and curious audience that her dances told stories from indian mythologyandjavanese folktales. soon the cream of paris, and ambassadors from faroff lands, were competing forinvitations tothesalon, where itwas rumored that mata. hari wasactually performing sacred dances inthenude. thepublicwanted toknow more about her. she toldjournaliststhat she wasactually dutch inorigin,buthad grown upontheisland ofjava. shewould also talkabout time spentinindia, how shehad learned sacred hindu dances there, and how indian women can shoot straight, ride horseback, and arecapableofdoing logarithmsand talkphilosophy. by the summer of1905, although few parisians hadactuallyseen mata hari dance, her name was oneveryones lips. asmata hari gavemore interviews, thestory ofherorigins kept changing:she had grown upinindia, hergrandmotherwas thedaughter ofajavanese princess,shehad lived ontheisland ofsumatra where she had spent hertime horsebaxzk riding, guninhand, andrisking herlife. no one knew certain about her, butjournalistsdidnotmind these changesinherbiography. they compared her toanindian goddess,a creature from thepages ofbaudelairewhatever their imaginationwanted toseeinthismysteriouswoman from theeast. inaugust of1905, mata hari performedforthefirst time inpublic. crowds throngingtoseeher onopening nightcaused ariot. she had now become acult

pected treasures, then allfrenchmen will emigratetothe shores ofthe ganges. soon thefame ofmata hari and her sacred indian dances spreadbe- yondparis. she was invited toberlin, vienna, milan. over the next few yearssheperformed throughout europe,mixed with thehighestsocial cir- cles, and earned anincome that gave her anindependence rarely enjoyed byawoman oftheperiod. then, near theend ofworld wari,she was ar- rested infrance, tried, convicted, andfinally executed asagermanspy. only during thetrial didthetruth come out: mata hari was notfromjava orindia, had notgrown upintheorient, did not have adropofeastern blood inherbody.her real name wasmargaretha zelle, and she came from thestolid northern province offriesland, holland. interpretation when margaretha zelle arrived inparis, in1904, she had half afranc in herpocket.she was one ofthethousands ofbeautifulyoung girls who flocked toparisevery year, taking work asartists models, nightclub dancers, orvaudeville performersatthefolies

hadhigher ambitions. she had nodance experience and had never performedinthetheater, but asayoung girlshehad traveled with herfamilyand had witnessed local dances injava and sumatra. zelle clearly

dc, and notonly refused tosupportteslas research butlater didallhecould tosabotage him. tesla turned tothegreat pittsburgh magnate george westinghouse, who had started his own electricity company. westinghouse completely funded tesla: research and offered him agenerous royalty agreementon future profits. the acsystemtesla developedisstillthestandard today- butafter patentswere filed inhisname, other scientists came forward to take credit fortheinvention, claimingthattheyhad laid thegroundwork forhim. his name was lostintheshuffle, and the publiccame toassociate theinvention with westinghousehimself. ayear later, westinghousewas caughtin amkeover bid from .pierpont morgan, who made him rescind thegenerous royaltycontract hehadsigned with tesla. westinghouse explainedtothescientist that his company would not survive ifithad topayhim hisfullroyalties;heper- suaded tesla toacceptabuyout ofhispatentsfor216,000-a large sum, nodoubt, butfarlessthan

therestoftheworld. nikola tesla was one ofthose. hebelieved science hadnothingtodowith politics,and claimed not tocare forfame and riches. ashegrew older, though,this ru- ined hisscientific work. not associated withanyparticular discovery, he could attract noinvestors tohismanyideas. while hepondered greatin- ventions forthefuture, others stole thepatentshehadalready developed andgotthegloryforthemselves. hewanted todoeverythingonhisown, butmerelyexhausted and im- poverished himselfin theprocess. edison was teslas polar opposite.hewasnt actually much ofascien tificthinker orinventor; heonce said that hehad noneed tobeamathe- matician because hecould alwayshire one. that was fdisoifs main method. he wasreallyabusinessman andpublicist, spottingthetrends and

thought about itsome more. what was thepoint,heasked himself, inobeyinganorder thatwould lead tofail- ure? and sohesent thesmaller mast, confident that theconsul would see how much more effective itwas and reward himjustly. when thesmaller mast arrived, mucianus asked hissoldiers for anex- planation. they described tohim how theengineerhadargued endlessly forthesmaller mast, buthadfinally promisedtosend thelargerone. mu- cianus went into arage. hecould not concentrate onthesiege,orconsider theimportanceofbreachingthewalls before thetown received reinforce merits. allhecould think about was theimpudent engineer, whom heor- dered tobebroughttohimimmediately. arrivingafewdays later, theengineer gladly explainedtotheconsul, one more time, the reasons forthesmaller mast hewent onand

hedidhisspyinginotherways:he would blurt outwhat seemed tobe asecret actually somethinghehad made up,then watch hislisteners reactions. hemight tell agatheringof diplomats,forinstance, that areliable

bytheweakeningoftherussianarmyperhaps their goverments had designsonrussia? asbaron von stetten said, monsieur talleyrand fires apistol into theairtoseewho willjumpoutthe window. during social gatherings and innocuous encounters, payattention. this iswhen peoples guardsaredown. bysuppressing yourown personal- ity,youcan make them reveal things.the brilliance ofthe maneuver is thattheywillmistake your interest inthem forfriendship,sothat younot only learn, youmalce allies. nevertheless, you should practicethis tactic with caution and care. if people begintosuspect youarewormingsecrets outofthem under the cover ofconversation, they willstrictlyavoid you. emphasize friendly chatter, notvaluable information. your search forgems ofinformation can- notbetooobvious, oryour probing questions willreveal more about your selfandyourintentions than about theinformationyouhopetofind. atrick totryinspyingcomes from larochefoucauld, who wrote, sincerityisfound invery few men, and isoften thecleverest ofruses one issincere inorder todraw outtheconfidence and secrets oftheother. bypretendingtobareyourheart toanother person,inother words, you make them more likelytoreveal their own secrets. give them afalse con fession andthey willgive youareal one. another trick was identified by thephilosopherarthur schopenhauer,who suggested vehementlycontra- dicting people youre inconversation with asawayofirritating them, stir ring them upsothatthey lose some ofthecontrol over their words. intheir emotional reaction they will reveal allkinds oftruths about themselves, truthsyoucanlater useagainstthem. another method ofindirect spyingistotestpeople,tolaylittle traps that make them reveal things about themselves. chosroes ii,anotoriously clever seventlrcentury kingofthepersians, hadmany ways ofseeing throughhissubjects without raising suspicion. ifhenoticed, forinstance, that two ofhiscouruers had become particularly friendly,hewould call oneofthem aside andsayhehad information that theother was atraitor, and would soon bekilled. thekingwould tellthecourtier hetmsted him more than anyone, and that hemust keepthisinformation secret. then he would watch the two mencarefully. ifhesaw that thesecond courtier had notchangedinhisbehavior toward theking, hewould conclude that the first courtier hadkeptthesecret, and hewould quickly promotetheman, later takinghim aside toconfess, imeant tokillyourfriend because of certain information that had reached me,but, when iinvestigatedthe mat- ter,ifound itwas untrue. if,ontheother hand, thesecond courtier started toavoid theking, acting aloof and tense, chosroes would know that the se cret had been revealed. hewould ban thesecond courtier from hiscourt, letting him know that thewhole business hadonlybeen atest, but that even thoughthe man had done nothing wrong,hecould nolongertrust him. the firstcourtier, however, had revealed asecret, and him chosroes would banfrom hisentire kingdom. itmayseem anodd form ofspyingthat reveals notempirical informa: tion but apersonscharacter. often, however, itisthebestway ofsolving problemsbefore theyarise. bytempting peopleinto certain acts, youlearn about their loyalty, their honesty, and soon.and this kind ofknowledge isoften the most valuable ofall:armed with it,youcanpredicttheir actions inthefuture. mage: the third eye of

knight. atthecastle ofjaviachemet and fellinlove with thebeautiful lady ofthehouse, madame guillelma dejaviac.hesang herhissongs,recited hispoetry, playedchess with her, and little bylittle sheinturn fellinlove with him. guillaume had afriend, sirpierre debar jac,who traveled with him and who was also received atthe castle. and pierre toofellinlove with aladyinjaviac,thegraciousbuttemperamental viemetta. then onedaypierre and viernetta had aviolent quarrel.the lady dismissed him, and hesought out hisfriend guillaume tohelpheal the breach andgethim back inhergood graces. guillaume was about toleave thecastle for awhile, but onhisreturn, several weeks later, heworked his magic,and pierre and theladywere reconciled. pierre feltthat hislove had increased tenfoldthat there was nostronger love, infact, than the love that follows reconciliation. the strongerandlongerthedisagreement, hetold guillaume, the sweeter thefeelingthat comes withpeaceand rapprochement, as atroubadour, sirguillaume prided himself onexperiencingallthe joysand sorrows oflove. onhearing hisfriends talk, hetoowanted know thebliss ofreconciliation after aquarrel. hetherefore feigned great anger withlady guillelma, stopped sendingherlove letters. andabruptly leftthe castle andstayed away,even during thefestivals and hunts. this drove the young ladywild. guillelma sentmessengerstoguillaume tofind outwhat bad hair pened,butheturned themessengers away. hethoughtallthiswould make herangry, forcing him topleadforreconciliation aspierre had. instead, however, hisabsence had theoppositeeffect: itmade guillelma love him allthe more. now thelady pursuedherknight, sending messengersand love notes ofher own. this was almost unheard of--a ladynever pursued her troubadour. and guillaume did notlike it.guillelmas forwardness made him feel shehad lost some ofherdignity.notonlywas henolonger sure ofhisplan,hewas nolongersure ofhislady. finally,after several months ofnothearing from guillaume, guillelma gave up.she sent him nomore messengers, andhebegantowonder-per- hapsshe wasangry? perhapstheplan had worked after all? somuch the better ifshe was. hewould wait nomore.-it was time toreconcile. sohe putonhisbest robe, decked thehorse initsfanciest caparison, chose a magnificent helmet, and rode ofitojaviac. onhearing that herbeloved had returned, guillelma rushed tosee him, knelt before him, droppedherveil tokisshim, andbegged forgive- ness forwhatever slighthad caused hisanger. imaginehisconfusion and despairw-his planhad failed abysmally.she was notangry, shehad never beenangry,she wasonly deeperinlove, and hewould never experience thejoyofreconciliation after aquarrel. seeingher now, andstilldesperate totaste thatjoy,hedecided totryone more time: hedrove heraway with harsh words andthreatening gestures.sheleft, this time vowingnever to seehim again. the next morningthetroubadour regretted what hehad done. he rode back tojaviac, butthelady would not receive him, and ordered her servants tochase himaway,across thedrawbridge and over thehill. guil- laume fled. back inhischamber hecollapsedand started tocry:hehad made aterrible mistake. over thenextyear,unable toseehislady,heex- perienced theabsence, theterrible absence, that canonly inflame love. he wrote oneofhismost beautiful poems, my songascends formercy pray- ing.and hesentmanyletters toguillelma, explaining what hehaddone, andbegging forgiveness. after agreat deal ofthis,lady guillelma, rememberinghisbeautiful songs,hishandsome figure,and hisskills indancingandfalconry, found herself yearning tohave him back. aspenance forhiscruelty,sheordered him toremove thenailfrom thelittle finger ofhisright hand, and tosend it toheralong with apoem describinghismiseries. hedid assheasked. finally guillaume debalaun was able totaste the ultimate sensation-a reconciliation even surpassingthat ofhisfriend pierre. interpretation trying todiscover thejoysofreconciliation, guillaume debalaun inadver tently experienced thetruth ofthelaw ofabsence andpresence.atthe start ofanaffair, youneed toheighten your presence intheeyes ofthe other. ifyou absent yourselftooearly, you maybeforgotten. but once yourlovers emotions areengaged,and thefeeling oflove hascrystallized, absence inflames and excites. givingno reason foryour absence excites even more: the otherpersonassumes heorshe isatfault. whileyouare away,theloversimaginationtakes flight,and astimulated imagination cannot helpbutmake love grow stronger. conversely,the more guillelma pursued guillaume, theless heloved hershe had become toopresent, tooaccessible, leavingnoroom forhisimaginationandfancy,sothat his feelingswere suffocating. when shefinally stopped sending messengers, hewas able tobreathe again,and toreturn tohisplan. what withdraws, what becomes scarce, suddenlyseems todeserve our respectand honor. whatstaystoolong, inundatinguswith itspresence, makes usdisdain it.inthemiddle ages,ladies were constantly putting their knights through trials oflove, sending them onsome longand ardu- ousquest-alltocreate apattern ofabsence andpresence. indeed, had guillaume

powertoanyone man, ortoestablish a monarchy. without aleader, however, thecountrysoon fellinto chaos, and fractured into small kingdoms, with village fighting against village. inone such village lived aman named deioces, who began tomake a name forhimself forfairdealingand theabilitytosettle disputes. hedidthis sosuccessfully,infact, that soonanylegalconflict inthe area wasbroughttohim, and hispowerincreased. throughouttheland, thelawhad fallen into disrepute-the judgeswerecorrupt,and noone en- trusted their cases tothe courtsany more, resorting toviolence instead. when news spread ofdeioces wisdom, incormptibility,and unshakable impartiality, medean villagesfarand wide turned tohim tosettle allman- nerofcases. soon hebecame thesole arbiter ofjusticeintheland. attheheightofhispower,deioces suddenlydecided hehad had enough.hewould nolongersitinthechair ofjudgment,would hear no more suits, settle nomore disputesbetween brother andbrother, village andvillage. complainingthat hewasspendingsomuch time dealing with other peoples problemsthat hehadneglected his own affairs, heretired. the countryonce again descended into chaos. with the sudden with- drawal

inthiscountryunder these conditions, said one tribal leader. let usap- pointone ofournumber torule sothat we canliveunder orderly govern- ment, rather than losingourhomes altogether inthepresentchaos. and so,despite allthat themedes had suffered under theassyrian des- potism, theydecided tosetupamonarchyand name aking. and the man theymost wanted torule, ofcourse,was thefair-minded deioces. he was hard toconvince, forhewanted nothingmore todowith thevillagesin- fightingandbickering,butthemedes beggedandpleadedwithouthim the countryhad descended into astate oflawlessness. deioces finally agreed. yethealsoimposedconditions. an enormous palacewas tobe con- structed forhim, hewas tobeprovidedwith bodyguards,and acapital city was tobebuilt from which hecould rule. allofthis wasdone, and deioces settled into hispalace.inthe center ofthecapital,thepalacewas sur- rounded bywalls, andcompletelyinaccessible toordinary people.deioces then established the terms ofhisrule: admission tohispresencewas for- bidden. communication with thekingwasonly possible throughmessen- gers.no one intheroyalcourt could seehim more than once aweek, and then only bypermission. deioces ruled forfiftythree years,extended themedean empire,and established thefoundation forwhat would later bethe persian empire, under hisgreatgreatgrandson cyrus. duringdeioces reign,thepeoples respect forhimgraduallyturned into aform ofworship:he was not amere mortal, they believed, butthe sonofagod. interpretation deioces was aman ofgreat ambition. hedetermined earlyonthat the country needed astrong ruler, and that hewas the man forthejob. lnaland plagued with anarchy, themost powerfulman isthejudge and arbiter. sodeioces began his career bymakinghisreputationasaman ofimpeccablefairness. attheheight ofhispowerasajudge, however, deioces realized the truth ofthelaw ofabsence andpresence: byservingsomany clients, he had become toonoticeable, tooavailable, and had lost therespecthehad earlier enjoyed. peoplewere taking hisservices forgranted. theonly way toregainthe veneration and powerhewanted was towithdraw com- pletely, and letthemedes taste what life was likewithout him. ashe ex- pected, theycame begging forhim torule. once deioces had discovered thetruth ofthislaw, hecarried ittoits ultimate realization. inthepalacehispeoplehadbuilt forhim, none could seehim

this time theorganizers had had enough: he wasgivenaforfeit. now he was down twogamestonone,at positionfrom which no one had ever come back towin achess champi- onship.fischer wasclearly unhinged.yetinthethirdgame,asallthose who witnessed itremember, hehad aferocious look inhiseye,alook that clearly bothered spassky. and despitethehole hehaddugforhimself, he seemed supremelyconfident.

crushinghim with brute force! inthe nextgamesfischer pulledmoves that no one had seen from him before, moves that were nothisstyle.now spassky started tomake blunders. after losing thesixth game, hestarted tocry.one grandmaster said, after this, spasskys gottoaskhimself ifitssafe togoback torus- sia. after theeighth game spasskydecided heknew what washappening: bobbyfischer washypnotizinghim.

allofthekingdomssur- rounding his own kingdom ofchin and unified them into one massive realm called china. butinthelastyears ofhislife,few,ifanyone,sawhim. theemperor lived inthe most magnificent palace built tothatdate, in thecapital ofhsien-yang.the palace had 270pavilions;allofthese were connected bysecret underground passageways, allowingtheemperorto move through thepalacewithoutanyone seeinghim. hesleptinadiffer- entroom every night, andanyonewhoinadvertentlylaideyesonhim was instantlybeheaded. onlyahandful ofmen knew hiswhereabouts, andif theyrevealed ittoanyone, they, too, were puttodeath. the firstemperorhadgrownsoterrified ofhuman contact that when hehad toleave thepalacehetraveled incognito, disguising himself care fully.on one suchtripthrough theprovinces,hesuddenly died. hisbody wasborne back tothecapitalintheemperors carriage, with acartpacked with salted fishtrailingbehind ittocoverupthe smell oftherotting corpse-noone was toknow ofhisdeath. hedied alone, farfrom his wives, hisfamily,hisfriends, and hiscourfiers, accompanied only bya minister and ahandful ofeunuchs. interpretation shih huang tistarted off astheking ofchin, afearless warrior ofunbri- dled ambition. writers ofthetime described him asaman with awaspish nose, eyeslikeslits, thevoice ofajackal,and theheart ofatigerorwolf. hecould bemerciful sometimes, but more often heswallowed menup without ascruple. itwasthrough trickeryand violence that heconquered theprovinces surroundinghis own and created china, forgingasinglena- tion and culture outofmany. hebroke upthefeudal system,and tokeep aneyeonthemanymembers oftheroyal families that were scattered across therealms various kingdoms, hemoved 120,000 ofthem tothecap- ital, where hehoused the most importantcouxtiers inthe vast

louis xiv came topowerattheend ofaterrible civil war, thefronde. a principal instigator ofthe war had been thenobility,which deeplyresented thegrowing power ofthethrone andyearned forthedays offeudalism, when thelords ruled their own fiefdoms and thekinghad little authority over them. the nobles had lostthecivil war, buttheyremained afractious, resentful lot. the construction ofversailles, then, was far more than thedecadent whim ofaluxury1oving king. itserved acrucial function: theking could keepaneyeand an ear oneveryoneandeverythingaround him. the once proud nobilitywas reduced tosquabblingover theright tohelpthe king putonhisrobes inthemorning. there was nopossibilityhere ofpm? vacy--no possibility ofisolation. louis xivvery early grasped thetruth thatfor

that thecommittee chairman was apassionate cigar smoker, answered their questions politely,andgenerallydeferred totheir authority. unlike theother witnesses, brecht answered thequestion ofwhether hebelongedtothecommunistparty:he was not amember, hesaid, which happenedtobethetruth. one committee member asked him, isit trueyouhave written anumber ofrevolutionary plays? brecht had writ- tenmany

ontheother hand, expressed hisdisgustatthe committee more indirectly.itwas notthat hechanged hisbeliefs orcompromisedhis values; instead, during hisshort testimony,hekepttheupperhand byap- pearingtoyieldwhile allthetime running circles around thecommittee withvague responses, outrightlies that went unchallenged because they were wrapped inenigmas,and wordgames.intheend hekept thefree-

mastered theartofcultmaking. they lived, aswedonow, inatime oftransformation: organized religionwas onthewane, science ontherise. peoplewere desperatetomllyaround anew cause orfaith. the charlatans had begun bypeddlinghealth elixirs and alchernic shortcuts towealth. moving quicklyfrom town totown, they originallyfocused onsmall groupsuntil, byaccident, theystumbled on atruth ofhuman nature: thelarger thegroup they gatheredaround themselves, theeasier itwas to deceive. the charlatan would station himself on ahigh wooden platform hence theterm mountebank and crowds would swarm around him. inagroup setting, peoplewere more emotional, less able toreason. had thecharlatan spokentothem individually, theymight have found himridiculous, butlost inacrowd they gotcaught upinacommunal mood

this you should donotthrough actions, which are too clear andreadable, butthrough words, which arehazyanddeceptive.your initial speeches, conversations, and interviews must include two elements: onthe

and seewhat theywant tosee. tomakeyour vagueness attractive, usewords ofgreatresonance but cloudy meaning, words fullofheat and enthusiasm. fancytitles forsimple thingsarehelpful,asarethe useofnumbers

schiippach,who had become known assimplythemountain doc- tor, had asmall pharmacyintown. this placebecame quiteascene: crowds ofpeoplefrommany different countries would cram thesmall room, itswalls lined with colorful bottles filled with herbal cures. where most doctors ofthetime prescribed foul-tastingconcoctions that bore in- comprehensiblelatin titles asmedicines often dostill, schiippaclfscures had names such asthe oilofjoy, little flowers heart, oragainst themonster, andthey tasted sweet andpleasing. visitors tolangnau would have towait patiently for avisit with the mountain doctor, becauseevery daysome eighty messengers would arrive atthepharmacy bearingflasks ofurine from allover europe. schiippach claimed hecould diagnose what ailedyousimply

expandedhistheories toproclaimthat allhumanity could be broughtintoharmony through thepowerofmagnetism,aconceptwith much appeal duringthefrench revolution. acult ofmesrnerism spread across thecountry;inmany towns, societies ofharmony sprang upto experiment with magnetism. these societies eventuallybecame notorious: theytended tobeledbylibertines who would turn their sessions into a kind ofgroup orgy. attheheight ofmesmers popularity,afrench commission published areportbased onyears oftesting thetheoryofanimal magnetism.the conclusion: magneusmseffects onthebody actuallycame from

eldorado. balboa was one ofthe first adventurers tocome insearch ofcolurnbuss land ofgold,and hehad de- cided from thebeginningthat hewould bethe one tofind it,through sheer audacity and singlemindedness. now that hewas free ofhiscredi- tors,nothingwould stophim. unfortunately theships owner, awealthy jurist named francisco fer- nandez deenciso, was furious when told ofthestowaway,and heordered thatbalboa beleft onthefirst island theycame across. before theyfound anyisland, however, enciso received news that thecolony he was tores- cuehad been abandoned. this was balboas chance. hetold thesailors of hisprevious voyagestopanarna, and ofthe rumors hehad heard ofgold inthe area. the excited sailors convinced enciso tosparebalboas life, and toestablish acolonyinpanama. weeks later theynamed their new settlement darien. dariens firstgovernorwas enciso, butbalboa was not aman tolet others steal the initiative. hecampaigned against encisoamongthe sailors, who eventuallymade itclear thatthey preferredhim asgovernor. enciso fled tospain, fearingforhislife. months later, when arepresenta- tiveofthespanishcrown arrived toestablish himself asthe new, official governor ofdarien, hewas turnedaway.onhisreturnvoyagetospain, this man drowned; thedrowningwas accidental, butunder spanish law, balboa had murdered thegovernorandusurpedhisposition. balb0as bravado had gothim outofscrapes before, but now his hopesofwealth andgloryseemed doomed. tolayclaim toeldorado, should hediscover it,hewould need theapproval ofthespanish king- which, asanoutlaw, hewould never receive. there wasonlyone solution. panamanian indians had told balboa ofavast ocean ontheother side of thecentral american isthmus, and had said diatbytraveling south upon this western coast, hewould reach afabulous land ofgold, called bya name that tohis ears sounded likebiru. balboa decided hewould cross thetreacherous jungles ofpanama and become thefirsteuropeantobathe hisfeetinthis new ocean. from there hewould march oneldorado. ifhe didthis onspains behalf, hewould obtain theeternal gratitudeofthe king, andwould secure his ownreprieve-onlyhehad toactbefore span- ishauthorities came toarrest

balboa hadonlyafew soldiers left. for themoment, hedecided, he should return todarien, send thejewels andgoldtospainasatoken ofgood will, and askfor alarge armytoaidhim intheconquest ofel dorado. when

ofthenew land. butbefore theking andqueenreceived word of hisdiscovery, theyhadalreadysent adozen ships,under thecommand of aman named pedro arias davila, pedrarias, with orders toarrest bal-

carrying shipbuildingmaterials and tools. once onthe pa cific coast, hewould create anarmada. with which toconquer the incas. surprisingly enough, pedrarias agreed totheplan--perhaps sensingit would never work. hundreds died inthis second march through thejun- gle, and thetimber theycarried rotted inthetorrential rains. balboa, as usual, was undaunted-nopowerintheworld could thwart hisplanand onarrivingatthepacific hebegantocutdown trees fornew lumber. but the men remaining tohim were toofew and tooweak tomount aninva- sion, and once againbalboa had toreturn todarien. pedrarias had inanycase invited balboa back todiscuss anew plan, and ontheoutskirts ofthesettlement, theexplorerwas metbyfrancisco pizarro, anoldfriend who hadaccompanied him onhisfirst crossingof theisthmus. but this was atrap: leadingone hundred soldiers, pizarro surrounded hisformer friend, arrested him, and returned him tofe draiias, who tried him oncharges ofrebellion. afewdays later ba.lboas head

delenclos found that herlifehad certain pleasures.her lovers came from royaltyand aristoc- racy,andthey paidherwell, entertained herwith their witand intellect, satisfied herrather demandingsensual needs, and treated heralmost asan equal.such alife wasinfinitely preferabletomarriage. in1643, however, ninons mother died suddenly, leaving her, attheageoftwenty-three, to tallyalone intheworld-no family,nodowry, nothing tofallback upon.a kind ofpanic overtook herand sheentered aconvent, tuming herback on herillustrious lovers. ayearlater sheleftthe convent andmoved tolyons. when shefinally reappearedinparis, in1648, lovers and suitors flocked to herdoor ingreaternumbers than ever before, forshe was thewittiest and most spiritedcourtesan ofthe time and herpresence had been greatly missed. ninons followers quickly discovered, however, that shehadchanged heroldway ofdoing things,and had setupanew systemofoptions.the dukes, seigneurs,andprinceswho wanted topayforher services could continue todoso,buttheywere nolongerincontrol-she would sleep with them when shewanted, according toher whim. alltheirmoney boughtthem was apossibility.ifitwasherpleasuretosleepwith themonly once amonth, sobeit. those who did not want tobewhat ninon called apayeurcould join thelargeandgrowing groupofmen shecalled hermartyrs--menwho vis itedherapartment principallyforherfriendship, herbiting wit, her lute- playing,and thecompanyofthe most vibrant minds oftheperiod, including moliere, larochefoucauld, and saintevremond. themartyrs, too,however, entertained apossibility: she would regularlyselect from them afiwori,aman who would become herlover without havingtopay, and towhom shewould abandon herself completelyfor aslongasshe so desired-a week, afewmonths, rarely longer. apayeurcould notbecome a favori,but amartyrhad noguarantee ofbecoming one, and indeed could remain disappointedfor anentire lifetime. the poet charleval, for examv pie,never enjoyedninons favors, but neverstopped comingtovisit--he didnotwant todowithout hercompany. asword ofthissystemreached politefrench society,ninon became theobject ofintense hostility.her reversal oftheposition ofthe courtesan scandalized thequeenmother and her court. much totheir horror, how- ever, itdidnotdiscouragehermale suitorsindeed itonlyincreased their numbers and intensified their desire, itbecame anhonor tobe apayeur, helpingninon tomaintain herlifestyle and herglittering salon, accompa- nyingher sometimes tothetheater, andsleeping with herwhen shechose. even more distinguishedwere themartyrs, enjoyinghercompanywithout payingforitandmaintainingthehope,however remote, ofsome daybe- comingherfizvorz.that possibility spurredonmanyayoung nobleman, as word spreadthat none amongthe courtesans

herself with a.bevy ofadmirers, a harem from which tochoose herlovers. the system, though, dependedon one critical factor: thepossibility, however remote, that amartyrcould become afawn. the illusion that riches, glory,orsensual satisfaction may someday fallintoyour victims lap isanirresistible carrot toinclude inyour listofchoices. thathope,how- ever slim, will make men accept the most ridiculous situations, because it leaves them theallimportant optionofadream. the illusion ofchoice, married tothepossibility offuture good fortune, will lure the most stub born sucker intoyour glittering web. keys to power words likefreedom, options, and choice evoke apowerofpossibility farbeyond therealityofthebenefits theyentail. when examined closely, thechoices wehavein themarketplace,inelections,

werarelyfocus onthemissing options. wechoose tobelieve that thegameisfair, and that wehave our freedom. weprefernot tothink toomuch about thedepth ofourlibertyto choose. this unwillingness toprobe thesmallness ofour choices stems from thefactthat toomuch freedom creates akind ofamdety.the phrase un- limited options sounds infinitely promising,butunlimited options would actually paralyzeusand

ofcontrollingthe options: color thechoices. this was afavored techniqueofhenry kissinger.as president richard nixons secretary ofstate, kissinger considered himself better informed than hisboss, andbelieved that inmost situations hecould make thebest decision onhis own. butifhetried todetermine policy,he would offend orperhaps enrageanotoriouslyinsecure man. sokissinger wouldproposethree orfour choices ofaction foreach situation, andwould presentthem insuch awaythat the one hepreferred always seemed the best solution comparedtothe others. time afler time, nixon fellforthe bait, never

orrather herlover,arole that made himper- hapsthemost powerfulman infrance. concini was vain andfoppish,and richelieu played himperfectly-attendingtohim asifhewere theking. within months richelieu had become one ofconcims favorites. but something happenedin1617 that turned everything upsidedown: the young king, who upuntil then had shown every signofbeinganidiot, had concini murdered and his most importantassociates imprisoned.in so doinglouis took command ofthecountrywith oneblow, sweepingthe queenmother aside. had richelieu played itwrong?hehad been close toboth concini and marie demdicis whose advisers and ministers were now alloutof favor, some even arrested. thequeenmother herself was shutupinthe louvre, avirtual prisoner.richelieu wasted notime. ifeveryonewas de- serfingmarie demdicis, hewould stand byher. heknew louis could not getridofher, forthekingwas stillvery young, and had inanycase always been inordinately attached toher. asmanes only remaining powerful friend, richelieu filled thevaluable function ofliaison between theking and hismother. inreturn hereceived herprotection,and was able to sur vive thepalace coup,even tothrive. over thenext fewyearsthe queen mother grewstill more dependentonhim, and in1622 sherepaidhim for hisloyalty: through theintercession ofherallies inrome, richelieu was elevated tothepowerfulrank ofcardinal. by1623 king louis was introuble. hehad no one hecould trust to advise him, andalthoughhewas now ayoungman instead ofaboy,here mained childish inspirit,and affairs ofstate came hard tohim. now that he had taken thethrone, marie was nolonger theregent andtheoreticallyhad nopower,but she still had her sons ear. and shekept tellinghim that richelieu was hisonly possiblesavior. atfirst louis would have none of it-he hated thecardinal with apassion, only toleratinghim outoflove for marie. intheend, however, isolated inthe court andcrippled byhis own iudecisiveness, heyieldedtohismother and made richelieu fixst hischief councilor and later primeminister. now richelieu nolongerneeded marie demdicis. hestoppedvisit- ingandcourting her,stopped listeningtoheropinions,even arguedwith herandopposedherwishes. instead beconcentrated ontheking, making himself indispensabletohisnew master. alltheprevious premiers,under standingthekings childishness, had tried tokeephim outoftrouble; the shrewd richelieu playedhimdifferently, deliberately pushinghim into one ambitious project after another, such as acrusade against the huguenots andfinallyanextended war with spain.theimmensityof these projects only made thekingmore dependentonhispowerful pre- mier, theonlyman able tokeeporder intherealm. and so,forthenext eighteen years, richelieu, exploiting thekings weaknesses, governedand molded france accordingtohis own vision, unifying thecountry and mak- ingitastrong european powerforcenturies tocome. lntcipretation richelieu saweverythingasamilitary campaign, and nostrategicmove was more importanttohim than discovering hisenemys weaknesses and applying pressuretothem. asearlyashisspeeohin1615, he waslooking fortheweak link inthechain ofpower, and hesaw that itwas thequeen mother, not that marie wasobviously weakmslie governedboth france andher son; butrichelieu saw that she wasreallyaninsecure woman who needed constant masculine attention. heshowered herwith afiection and respect,even toadying uptoherfavorite, concini. heknew thedaywould come when thekingwould take over, buthealso recognized that louis loved hismotherdearlyand would always remain achild inrelation toher. thewaytocontrol louis, then, was notbygaininghisfavor, which could change overnight, butbygaining swayover hismother, forwhom hisafv fection would never change. once richelieu had thepositionhedesiredm-primeministerhe dis- carded thequeen mother, movingontothenext weak link inthechain: thekingsown character. there was apart ofhim that would alwaysbe a. helpless child inneed ofhigher authority.itwas onthefoundation ofthe kings weakness that richelieu established his ownpowerand fame. remember: when enteringthecourt, find theweak link. theperson incontrol isoften notthekingorqueen;itissomeone behind the scenes- thefavorite, thehusband orwife, even thecourt fool. thisperson may have more weaknesses than theking himself, because hispower depends onallkinds ofcapricious factors outside hiscontrol. finally, when dealing with helplesschildren who cannot make deci- sions, playontheir weakness andpush them into bold ventures, they will have todependonyoueven

italso meant that hehad toremain incourt, where catherine could keepaneyeonhim. her next move provedsmarter still: antoine had a notorious weakness foryoung women, sosheassigned oneofher most at-

asthe woman began theaffair byactingasifshehad beenconquered,the man would fail tonotice that asdine passedthemistress had come tohold powerover him, asdiane depoitiers did over henri. itwas catherines strategytoturn this weakness toheradvantage, using itasawaytoconquer and control men. allshehad todowas unleash theloveliest women inthe court, herflying squadron,on men whom she knew

her asanupstart. onlyone man ofconsequence treated herdiflerently:thedealer josephduveen. forthefirst fewyearsofduveens relationshipwith arabella, hemade noeifort tosellexpensivearttoher. instead

asifshealwayshadexquisite taste, even though before she met him her aesthetics had been abysmal. when collis huntington died, in1900, arabella came into afortune. she suddenly started tobuy expensive

ofking,and notjustbecause hecame from adifferent branch of theroyal family,orbecause hehad notinherited the crown buthad been given it,byacommission, puttinghislegitimacyinquestion.rather itwas that hedislikedceremonyand thetrappings ofroyalty;hehad more friends among thebankers thanamongthenobility;and hisstylewas not tocreate anew kind ofroyal rule, asnapoleonhaddone, buttodownplay hisstatus, thebetter tomix with thebusinessmen and middle-class folk who had called him tolead. thus thesymbolsthat came tobeassociated withlouis-philippewere neither thescepternor the crown, but thegray hatandumbrella with which hewould proudlywalk thestreets ofparis, as ifhewere abourgeois outfor astroll. vvhen louisphilippeinvited james rothschild, the most importantbanker infrance, tohispalace,hetreated him asanequal.and unlikeanyking before him, notonlydidhetalk busi- nesswith monsieur rothschild butthat wasliterallyallhetalked, forhe loved moneyand had amassed ahuge fortune. asthereignofthebourgeois king plodded on,peoplecame tode spirehim. the aristocracy could notendure thesightofanunkingly king, andwithin afewyears they turned onhim. meanwhile thegrowing class of thepoor, including theradicals who had chased outcharles x,found no satisfaction inaruler who neither acted asakingnorgovernedasaman of thepeople.the bankers towhom louis-philippewas themost beholden soon realized thatitwastheywho controlled thecountry,nothe,andthey treated him with growing contempt. one day,atthestart ofatraintripor- ganizedfortheroyal family, jamesrothschild actually berated him-and iripublic-for being late. once thekinghad made news bytreatingthe banker asanequal;now thebanker treated thekingasaninferior. eventually theworkers insurrections that hadbrought down louis-

aristocracy. this view waspassedintohistory throughabiographywritten after the ex- plorersdeath byhisson, which describes him asadescendant ofacount colombo ofthecastle ofcuccaro inmontferrat. colombo inturn was said tobedescended from thelegendary roman general colonius, and twoof hisfirst cousins were supposedly direct descendants ofanemperor ofcon stantinople.anillustrious backgroundindeed. but itwasnothingmore than illustrious fantasy,forcolumbus wasactuallythe sonofdomenico colombo,ahumble weaver who hadopenedawine shop when christa pherwas ayoung man, and who then made hisliving byselling cheese. columbus himself had created themyth ofhisnoble background, be- cause from earlyonhefelt thatdestiny had singledhim out forgreat things, and that hehad akind ofroyaltyinhisblood. accordinglyheacted asifhewere indeed descended from noble stock. after anuneventful ca- reer as amerchant on 3commercial vessel, columbus, originallyfrom genoa, settled inlisbon. using thefabricated story ofhisnoble back ground,hemarried into anestablished lisbon family that had excellent connections with portuguese royalty. through hisinlaws, columbus finagledameetingwith thekingof portugahjoao ii,whom hepetitionedtofinance awestwardvoyage aimed atdiscoveringashorter route toasia. inreturn forannouncingthatany discoveries heachieved would bemade inthekings name, columbus ihwanted aseries ofrights: thetitle grand admiral oftheoceanic sea; the office ofviceroyoveranylands hefound; and 10percentofthefuture commerce with such lands. allofthese rightswere tobehereditaryandfor alltime. columbus made these demands even thoughhehadpreviously been amere merchant, heknew almost nothing about navigation,hecould notwork aquadrant,and hehad never led agroupofmen. inshort hehad absolutelynoqualificationsforthejourneyheproposed. furthermore, his petitionincluded nodetails astohow hewould accomplishhisplans, just vague promises. then columbus finished hispitch, joao iismiled: hepolitelyde- clined theoffer, butleftthedooropenforthefuture. here columbus must have noticed somethinghewould never forget: even astheking turned down the sailors demands, hetreated them aslegitimate. heneither laughedatcolumbus norquestioned hisbackgroundand credentials. in factthekingwasimpressed bytheboldness ofcolumbussrequests,and clearlyfeltcomfortable inthecompany ofaman who acted soconfidently. themeetingmust have convinced columbus that hisinstincts were cor rect:byaskingforthemoon, hehadinstantly raised his own status, forthe king assumed that unless aman who setsuch ahigh priceonhimself were mad, which columbus didnotappear tobe,hemust somehow beworth it. afew years later columbus moved tospain. usinghisportuguese connections, hemoved inelevated circles atthespanish court, receiving subsidies from illustrious financiers and sharing tables with dukes and princes.toallthese men berepeated hisrequestforfinancing for avoyage tothewe-stand also

perception oftime. byupsetting thetiming ofyour op ponentwhileyoustaypatient, you open uptime foryourself, which ishalf thegame. in1473 thegreatturkish sultan mehmed theconquerorinvited nego- tiations with hungarytoend theelf-andam war the two countries had waged foryears.when thehungarian emissaryarrived inturkeytostart thetalks, turkish officials humbly apologizedmehmed hadjustleftistan- bul,

al- readyleftit,movingeastward inpursuit ofhisswift foe. thishappened several times. wherever theemissary stopped,thethrks lavished gifts and banquetsonhim, inpleasurablebuttimeconsuming ceremonies. finally mehrned defeated uzun and met with theemissary. yethisterms forpeace with hungarywere excessivelyharsh. after afewdays,thenegotiations ended, and theusual stalemate remained inplace. but this was fine with mehmecl. infact hehadplanneditthatwayallalong: plotting his cam- paign against uzun, hehad seen thatdiverting hisarmies tothe eastwould leave hiswestern flank vulnerable. toprevent hungary from taking advan tageofhisweakness and hispreoccupation elsewhere, heflrstdangled the lure ofpeacebefore hisenemy, then made them wait-all onhis own terms. making peoplewait isapowerful way offorcing time, aslongasthey donotfigureoutwhat youareupto.you control theclock, they linger in limbowand rapidlycome unglued, opening upopportunitiesforyouto strike. the oppositeeffect isequally

wrote, would be atest ofamerican power. the soldiers carried the latest in weaponry,communicated byradio, and were supported byreconnais- sance from theair. inthefirst fewmonths, thetroops split

decided hehad tofind a waytogetridofhiswife, catherine ofaragon. catherine had failed topro- duce ason, amale heir who would ensure thecontinuance ofhisdynasty, andhenry thought heknew why: hehad read

brother arthur, butarthur had died five months later. henry had waited anappropriate time, then hadmarried hisbrothers widow. catherine was thedaughterofking ferdinand andqueenisabella of spain,andbymarrying herhenry hadkeptalive avaluable alliance. now, however, catherine had toassure him that herbrief marriagewith arthur had never been consummated. otherwise henrywould view their rela- tionshipasincestuous and their marriageasnull and void. catherine in- sisted that shehad remained avirgin throughhermarriagetoarthur, and popeclement viisupportedherbygivinghisblessingtotheunion, which hecould nothave done had heconsidered itincestuous. yetafter yearsof marriagetohenry, catherine had failed toproduceason, and intheearly 1520s shehad enteredmenopause.totheking this could onlymean one thing: she had lied about hervirginity,their union was incesmous, and god hadpunishedthem. there was another reason whyhenry wanted togetridofcatherine: hehad fallen inlove with ayounger woman, anne boleyn. notonlywas heinlove with her, butifhemarried herhecould stillhopetosire alegiti- mate son. the marriage tocatherine had

theyear478 b.c., thecityofspartasent anexpeditiontopersia led bytheyoung spartan nobleman pausanias. the citystatesofgreece had recently fought off amightyinvasion from persia, and now pausanias, along with allied shipsfrom athens, had orders topunish theinvaders and win back the islands and coastal towns that the persians had occupied. both theathenians and thespartanshad great respectforpausanias-he had proven himself asafearless warrior, with aflair forthedramatic. with amazing speed, pausanias and histroops took cyprus, then moved ontothemainland ofasia minor known asthehellespontand captured byzantium modem-day istanbul. now master ofpart oftheper- sianempire,pausanias begantoshow signsofbehavior that went beyond hisnormal flarnboyance.heappearedinpublic wearing pomadesinhis hair andflowing persian robes, andaccompanied byabodyguard ofegyp- tians. heheld lavish banquets inwhich hesatinthepersian manner and demanded tobeentertained. hestopped seeing hisoldfriends, entered into communication with the persian king xerxes, and allinallaffected thestyle and manner ofapersian dictator. clearly powerand success had gone topausaniass head. hisarmy- athenians andspartans alikeat firstthoughtthis apassing fancy:hehad always been abitexaggerated inhisgestures. but when heilaunted hisdis- dain forthegreeks simple wayoflife, and insulted the common greek soldier, they begantofeel hehadgone toofar.although there was nocon crete evidence forthis, rumors spreadthat hehadgoneover totheother side, and that hedreamed ofbecomingakind ofgreek xerxes. toquell thepossibility ofmutiny,thespartansrelieved pausanias ofhiscommand and called him home. pausanias, however, continued todress inthe persian style,even in sparta.after afewmonths beindependentlyhired atrireme and returned tothehellespont, tellinghiscompatriots hewasgoingtocontinue thefight against thepersians. actually, however, hehad differentplanstomake himself ruler ofallgreece, with theaidofxerxes himself. the spartans declared him apublic enemyand sent ashiptocapturehim. pausanias sur- rendered, certainlthat hecould clear himself ofthecharges oftreason. it did come outduringthetrial thatduringhisreignascommander hehad offended hisfellow greeks time and again, erecting monuments, forin- stance, inhisown name, rather than inthose ofthecities whose troopshad fought alongside him, aswas the custom. yetpausanias proved right:de spite theevidence ofhis numerous contacts with theenemy, thespartans refused toimprisonaman ofsuch noble birth, and lethimgo. now thinking himself untouchable, pausanias hired amessengerto take aletter toxerxes, butthe messenger instead took theletter tothe spartan authorities. these men wanted tofind out more, sotheyhad the messenger arrangetomeet pausanias inatemple where theycould hide and listen behind apartition. lvhat pausanias said shocked them-they had never heard such contemptfortheirways spokensobrazenly byone oftheir 0wn-and they made arrangementsforhisimmediate arrest. onhiswayhome from thetemple, pausanias gotword ofwhat had happened.he ran toanother templetohide, but theauthorities followed himthere andplaced sentries allaround. pausanias refused tosurrender. unwillingtoforciblyremove him from thesacred temple,theauthorities kepthimtrapped inside, until heeventually died ofstarvation. interpretation atfirstglanceitmightseem that pausanias simplyfellinlove with another culture, aphenomenonasold astime. never comfortable with the asceti- cism ofthespartans,hefound himself enthralled bythe persian love of luxuryand sensual pleasure.heputonpersian robes andperfumeswith a sense ofdeliverance from greek disciplineandsimplicity. this ishow itappearswhenpeople adoptaculture inwhich

guered,abook attacking free-thinkers, machiavellians, calvinists, and heretics ofallstripes.the book iswritten intheform ofdebates inwhich heretics express their beliefs and arecountered byarguments forthesupe riority ofcatholicism. campanella had obviously reformed-his book made that clear. ordidit? the argumentsinthemouths oftheheretics had never before been expressedwith such verve and

ontheother hand, heresorted tostale clichs and convoluted rationales. brief andeloquent, theheretics arguments seemed bold and sincere. thelengthy arguments forcatholicism seemed tiresome and 1m convincing. catholics who read thebook found itdisturbing andambiguous,but theycould notclaim itwas heretical, orthatcampanellashould be re- turned toprison.his defense ofcatholicism, after all,used arguments they hadused themselves. yetintheyears tocome, atizeism conquered became a bible foratheists, machiavellians and liberfines who used thearguments campanellahadputintheir mouths todefend their dangerous ideas. com- bininganoutward display ofconformity with anexpressionofhistrue he liefsinawaythat hissympathizerswould understand, campanella showed thathehad learned hislesson. interpretation intheface ofawesome persecution, campanella devised three strate- gicmoves that saved hishide, freed him from prison,and allowed him to continue toexpresshisbeliefs. first

stood higher inenglish society than theduke and duchess ofmarlborough.the duke, havingled sue cessful campaigns againstthefrench, was considered europes premier generalandstrategist. and hiswife, theduchess, after much maneuvering, hadestablished herself asthefavorite ofqueen anne, who became ruler ofengland in1702. in1704 thedukes triumphatthebattle ofblenheim made him the toast ofengland,and tohonor him thequeen awarded him alarge plot ofland inthe town ofwoodstock, and thefunds tocreate a great palace there. calling hisplannedhome thepalace ofblenheim, the duke chose ashisarchitect theyoung john vanbrugh,akind ofrenais- sance man who wroteplaysaswell asdesigned buildings.and so con struction began,inthe summer of1705, with much fanfare andgreat hopes. vanbrugh had adramatists sense ofarchitecture. hispalacewas tobe amonument tomar1boroughs brilliance and power, and was toinclude artificial lakes, enormous bridges,elaborate gardens,and other fantastical touches. from day one, however, theduchess could notbepleased: she thought vanbrughwaswasting moneyonyetanother stand oftrees; she wanted thepalacefinished assoon aspossible. the duchess tortured van brugh and hisworkmen onevery detail. she was consumed with petty matters; although thegovernmentwaspayingforblenheim, shecounted every penny. eventuallyhergrumbling,about blenheim and other things too,created anirreparable riftbetween herandqueen anne, who, in1711, dismissed herfrom thecourt, ordering her tovacate herapartmentsatthe royal palace.when theduchess leftfumingover theloss ofherposition, and

ofthe law observance i pietro aretino, sonofalowly shoemaker, hadcatapultedhimself into fame asawriter ofbitingsatires. but likeevery renaissance artist, heneeded to find apatronwho would givehim acomfortable lifestylewhile notinter feringwith hiswork. in1528 aretino decided toattemptanew strategyin thepatronage game. leaving rome, heestablished himself invenice, where fewhad heard ofhim. hehad afair amount ofmoneyhehad man- agedtosave, butlittle else. soon after hemoved into his new home, how- ever, heflirewopenitsdoors torich andpoor, regalingthem with banquetsand amusements. hebefriended each andevery gondolier, tip- pingthem royally.inthestreets, hespreadhismoney liberally, giving it awaytobeggars, orphans,washerwomen. amongthecitys commoners, word quickly spreadthat aretino was more thanjustagreat writer, hewas aman ofpower-akind oflord. artists and men ofinfluence soon begantofrequentareunos house. within afew years hemade himself acelebrity;novisiting dignitary would think ofleaving venice without payinghim acall. hisgenerosityhad cost him most ofhissavings,buthadboughthim influence and agoodname acornerstone inthefoundation ofpower.since inrenaissance italyas elsewhere theabilitytospend freelywas theprivilege oftherich, the arisv tocracy thought aretino had tobe aman ofinfluence, since hespent money like one. and since theinfluence ofaman ofinfluence isworth buying,aretino became therecipient ofallsorts ofgifts andmoneys. dukes and duchesses, wealthy merchants, andpopesandprincescom- petedtogainhisfavor, and showered him with allkinds ofpresents. aretinos spending habits, ofcourse, were strategic,and thestrategy worked like acharm. butforrealmoneyand comfort heneeded agreat patrons bottomless pockets. having surveyedthepossibilities,heeventu- allysethissightsontheextremely wealthy marquisofmantua, and wrote anepic poemthat hededicated tothemarquis.this was acommonprac- ticeofwriters lookingforpatronage: inexchangefor adedication they would getasmall stipend, enoughtowrite yetanotherpoem,sothatthey spenttheir lives inakind ofconstant servility. aretino, however, wanted power,not ameasly wage.hemight dedicate apoem tothemarquis,but hewould offer ittohim asagift,implying bydoingsothat hewas not a hired hack lookingfor astipendbutthat heand themarquiswere equals. aret.inos gift-givingdid notstop there: as aclose friend oftwo of venices greatest artists, thesculptor jacoposansovino and thepainter titian, heconvinced these men toparticipateinhisgift-giving scheme. aretino had studied themarquisbefore goingtowork onhim, and knew histaste inside and out; he was able toadvise sansovirio and titian what subject matter would pleasethemarquismost. when hethen sent asanso- vino sculptureand atitian paintingtothemarquisasgiftsfrom allthree of them, the man was beside himself withjoy. over the next fewmonths, aretino sent other giftsswords, saddles, theglassthat was avenetian specialty, things heknew themarquis prized. soon he,titian, and sansovino began toreceive gifts from themarquisin return. and thestrategy went further: when the son-inlaw ofafriend of aretinos found himself injailinmantua, aretino was able togetthe mar- quistoarrange hisrelease. aretinds friend, awealthy merchant, was a man ofgreatinfluence invenice; byturningthegoodwillhehad builtupyour:

aretino had nowboughtthismans indebtedness, too, and heinturn would help aretino when hecould. the circle ofinflu- ence wasgrowingwider. time andagain, aretino was able tocash inon theimmense political power ofthemarquis,who alsohelped him inhis manycourt romances. eventually, however, therelationship became strained, asaretino came tofeel that themarquisshould have requitedhisgenerosity better. but hewould notlower himself tobeggingorwhining:since theexchange ofgifts between thetwo men had made themequals,itwould not seem righttobring upmoney.hesimply withdrew from themarquisscircle and hunted forother wealthy prey, settling first onthefrench king francis, then themedicis, theduke ofurbino, emperor charles v,and more. in theend, having many patronsmeant hedid nothave tobow toany of them, and hispower seemed comparabletothat ofagreatlord. interpretation aretino understood twofundamental properties ofmoney: first, thatithas tocirculate tobring power. whatmoneyshould buyisnotlifeless objects butpowerover people. bykeeping money inconstant circulation, aretino boughtaneverexpanding circle ofinfluence that intheend more than compensatedhim forhisexpenses. second, aretino understood thekeypropertyofthegift.togiveagift istoimplythatyouand therecipientareequalsatthevery least, orthat youaretherecipients superior. agiftalso involves anindebtedness or obligation;when friends, forinstance, offer yousomething forfree, you can be surethey expect somethinginreturn, and that togetittheyare making youfeel indebted. the mechanismmayormaynot beentirely conscious ontheirpaxt,butthis ishow itworks. aretino avoided such encumbrances onhisfreedom. instead ofacting like amenial whoexpectsthepowerful topayhiswayinlife, heturned the whole dynamic around; instead ofbeingindebted tothepowerful,he made thepowerful indebted tohim. this was thepoint ofhisgift-giving,a ladder that carried him tothehighestsocial levels. bytheendofhislifehe had become themost famous writer ineurope. understand: money maydeterminepower relationships,butthose re- lationshipsneed notdependontheamount ofmoney you have; theyalso dependontheway youuseitpowerful people give freely, buyinginflu- ence rather them things. ifyou accept theinferior position becauseyou have nofortuneyet, you may findyourselfinitforever. playthetrick that aretino playedonita.lys aristocracy: imagine yourselfanequal. playthe lord, givefreely, open your doors, circulate your money, and create thefa- cade ofpower throughanalchemythat transforms money into influence. observance ii soon after baron jamesrothschild made hisfortune inparis intheearly 1820s, hefaced hismost intractable problem: how could ajew and 3.ger man, atotal outsider tofrenchsociety,win therespectofthexenophobic frenchupperclasses? rothschild was aman who understood power--he knew that hisfortune would bringhim status, but that ifheremained so ciallyalienated neither hisstatus nor hisfortune would last. sohelooked at thesocietyofthetime and asked what would wintheir hearts. charity?the french couldnt care less. political influence? healready hadthat, andifanythingitonlymade peoplemore suspicious

hehired thebest architects infrance todesign hisgardensandballroom; hehired marie-antoine carme, the most celebrated french chef, topreparethe most lavish partiesparis had ever witnessed; nofrenchman could resist, even ifthepartieswere given byagerman jew. rothschilds weekly soires begantoattract biggerandbigger numbers. over the next few years hewon theonly thingthat would secure anoutsiderspower:social acceptance. interpretation strategic generosityisalwaysagreat weaponinbuildingasupport base, particularlyfortheoutsider. butthebaron derothschild was cleverer still: heknew

tostudyorpleaseothers orprove himself. hestood alone atthetopofagreat country, with wealth andpowerathiscommand. hecould do ashewished. inthefirstyearsofhisreign, louis gavehimself over topleasure, leav- ingthegovernmentinthehands ofaousted minister, andr-hercule de fleuiy.this caused little concern, forhewas a.youngman who needed to sow hiswild oats, and defleurywas agood minister. butitslowly became clear that his was more than apassing phase. louis had nointerest ingov- erning.his mainworrywas notfrances finances, orapossiblewar with spain,butboredom. hecould notstand being bored, andwhen hewas not hunting deer, orchasing young girls, hewhiledawayhistime atthegain- bling tables, losing hugesums inasingle night. the court, asusual, reflected the tastes oftheruler. gambling and lav- ishparties became theobsession. the courtiers had noconcern with thefu- ture offrance-they pouredtheir energies intocharmingtheking, angling fortitles that would bringthem lifepensions,and forcabinet positionsde- manding little work butpaying huge salaries. parasites flocked tothecourt, and thestates debts swelled. in1745 louis fellinlove with madame depompadour,awoman of middlecla,ss originwho

older louis only needed more diversion. onthegrounds ofversailles hebuilt abrothel, pare aux cerfs, which housed some ofthe prettiest young girlsoffrance. underground passagesand hidden stair- cases gave louis access atallhours. after madame depompadour died, in 1764, she was succeeded asroyal mistress bymadame dubariy, who soon came todominate thecourt, and who, like depompadour before her, begantomeddle inaffairs ofstate. ifaminister didnotpleaseherhewould find himself fired. allofeuropewasaghastwhen dubarry,thedaughterof abaker, managedtoarrange thefiring ofetienne dechoiseul,

forhisfather, king philipofmacedonia. hehated philips cunning, cautious styleofruling,hisbombastic speeches,hisdrinking andwhoring, and hislove ofwrestlingand ofother wastes oftime. alexander knew he had tomake himself thevery oppositeofhisdomineeringfather: hewould force himself tobebold andreckless, hewould control histongueand bea man offewwords, and hewould notlose precious time inpursuitofplea- sures thatbroughtnoglory.alexander also resented thefact thatphilip hadconqueredmost ofgreece: myfather willgoonconqueringtillthere isnothing extraonhnaryleftfor me todo, he once complained.vllhile other sons ofpowerfulmen were content toinherit wealth and live alifeof leisure, alexander wanted onlytooutdo hisfather, toobliterate philips name from history bysurpassinghisaccomplishments. alexander itched toshow others how superior hewas tohisfather. a thessalian h0rsedealer once broughtaprizehorse named bucephalusto sell tophilip. none ofthekings grooms could getnear thehorseit was fartoosavagea.nd philipberated themerchant forbringinghim such a useless beast. watchingthewhole affair, alexander scowled and com- mented, what ahorse theyarelosing forwant ofskill andspirittoman agehim! when hehad said this several times, philiphadfinallyhad enough,andchallengedhim totake onthehorse. hecalled themerchant back, secretly hopinghis sonwould have anastyfa.lland learn abitter les- son. butalexander was the one toteach thelesson: notonlydidhemount bucephalus,hemanagedtoride him atfullgallop, tamingthehorse that would latercarryhim allthewaytoindia. the courtiers applauded wildly, butphilip seethed inside, seeing not asonbut arival tohispower. alexanders defiance ofhisfather grew bolder. one daythe two men had aheated argument before theentire court, andphilip drew hissword asiftostrike his son; havingdrunk too much wine, however, theking stumbled. alexander pointedathisfather andjeered,men ofmacedonia, seethere the man who ispreparingtopass from europetoasia. hecannot passfrom one table toanother without falling. when alexander was eighteen,adisgruntled courtier murdered philip.asword oftheregicide spread through greece, city after cityrose upinrebellion against their macedonian rulers. philipsadvisers counseled alexander, now theking,toproceed cautiously,todo asphiliphad done andconquer through cunning.butalexander would dothings hisway:he marched tothefurthest reaches ofthekingdom, suppressed therebellious towns, and reunited theempire with brutal efficiency. as ayoungrebelgrows older, hisstruggle against thefather often wanes, and hegraduallycomes toresemble theveryman hehad wanted to defy.butalexandefs loathing ofhisfather did notendwith phi.lips death. once hehad consolidated greece, hesethiseyesonpersia, theprize that hadeluded hisfather, who had dreamed ofconqueringasia. ifhedefeated thepersians, alexander would finally surpass philipingloryand fame. alexander crossed into asia with anarmy of35,000 toface 3.persian force numberingover amillion. before engaging thepersians inbattle he passed throughthe town ofgordium. here, inthetowns main temple, there stood anancient chariot tied with cords made oftherind ofthe cor- neltree. legendhad itthatanyman who could undo these cordsthe gordian knotwould rule theworld. manyhad tried tountie the enor mous and intricate knot, but none had succeeded. alexander, seeing he could notpossiblyuntie theknot with hisbare hands, took outhissword andwith one slash cutitinhalf. this symbolic gesture showed theworld thathewould notdo asothers, butwould blaze hisown path. against astounding odds, alexander conquered thepersians. most ex- pectedhim tostop there--it was agreat triumph, enough tosecure his fame foreternity.but alexander had the same relationshiptohis own deeds ashehad tohisfather: hisconquest ofpersia represented thepast, andhewanted never torest onpasttriumphs,ortoallow thepast toout- shine thepresent. hemoved ontoindia, extendinghisempire beyond all known limits. onlyhisdisgruntled and weary soldiers prevented him from goingfarther. interpretation alexander representsanextremelyuncommon

because hebeginswith little ornothing. adesperate urge irnpels him tosucceed-he hasnothing tolosebycunningandimpetuousness, and has nofamous father ofhis own tocompete against.this kind ofman has

stirupanxieties, allofwhich could lead totheruin oftheir democracy. violentpunishmentnolonger suited the new, civilized order that athens had created. instead thecitizens found another, more

citizen: hedidnot care whatanyone thoughtofhim, and slandered whomever he disliked. heamused some, butirritated manymore. in417 b.c.,hyperbo- lus saw anopportunitytostirupauger againstthe twoleading politicians ofthetime, alcibiades and nicias. hehopedthat oneofthetwowould be ostracized and that hewould rise inthat mans place.hiscampaign seemed likelytosucceed: the athenians disliked alcibiades flamboyant and carefree lifestyle,and were wary ofnicias wealth and aloofness. they seemed certain toostracize one orthe other. but alcibiades and nicias, although theywere otherwise enemies, pooledtheir resources and managed toturn the ostracism onhyperbolusinstead. his obnoxious- ness, they argued,could onlybeterminated bybanishment. earlier sufferers ofostracism had been formidable, powerfulmen. hyperbolus, however,was alowbuffoon, and with hisbanishment the athenians feltthat ostracism had been degraded. and sotheyended the practicethat fornearlyahundredyearshad been

overweening ambition attheexpense ofthe common good; theflauntingofsuperiority; quiet scheming;terminal obnoxiousness. some ofthese behaviors would eatawayatthecitys cohesion bycreating factions andsowing dissension, others would ruin thedemocratic spirit bymaking the common citizen feel inferior and envious. the athenians did nottrytoreeducate people who acted inthese ways,ortoabsorb them

aseparate world, its community limited toherchosen favofites. with each newwhim, the cost ofmaintainingthepetit trianon soared. meanwhile. france itself wasdeteriorating: there was famine and wide

marieantoinette did not concern herself with this. not once throughout herreigndid she read a ministers report.not once didshe tour theprovinces andrallythepeople toherside. not once didshemingle

andsupporter,oneday even riskinghis own lifetorescue theyoungman inbattle. the athenians considered alcibiades their greatest orator, forhehad anuncanny abilitytotune intohisaudiences aspirations,and mirror their desires. hemade hisgreatest speechesinsupportoftheinvasion ofsicily, which hethought would bring greatwealth toathens and limitless glory to himself. the speeches gave expressiontoyoungathenians thirst tocom querlands forthemselves, rather thanliving offthevictories oftheir a.nces tors. but healso tailored hiswords toreflect older mens nostalgia forthe glory yearswhen athens ledthegreeks against persia, and then went onto create anempire. allathens now dreamed ofconquering sicily; alcibi- ades planwasapproved,and hewas made theexpeditions commander. while alcibiades wasleading theinvasion ofsicily, however, certain athenians fabricated charges againsthim ofprofaningsacred statues. he knew hisenemies would have him executed ifhereturned home, soatthe

order inengland, with thepowerofthecatholic church smashed and itsvast wea.lth inthe hands ofthekingand thegovernment. inthat sameyear heinitiated a complete surveyofthechurches and monasteries ofengland. and asit turned out, the treasures andmoneysthat thechurches had accumulated over the centuries were far more than hehadimagined;hisspiesand agentscame back with astonishing figures. tojustifyhisschemes, cromwell circulated stories about thecorrup- tion intheenglish monasteries, their abuse ofpower,their exploitation of thepeople they supposedlyserved. havingwon parliamenfs support for breaking upthemonasteries, hebegantoseize their holdingsand toput them outofexistence onebyone. atthe same time, hebegantoimpose protestantism, introducingreforms inreligiousritual andpunishing those who stuck tocatholicism, and who now were called heretics. virtually overnight, englandwas converted toanew official religion. aterror fell onthecountry. some people had suffered

the diaries beganto describe halliwells brooding, hisrude comments atparties,hisgrowing sense ofinferiority.allofthisorton narrated with adistance that bordered oncontempt. the diaries made clear

highoffice could onlybeheld for afewmonths, no one could gain lasting dominance, andalthoughthis meant that thepoliti calfactions struggled constantlyforcontrol, thesystem kept outtyrants andpettydictators. the medici family lived forseveral centuries under this system without makingmuch of amark. theyhad modest originsas apothecaries,and were typical middle-class citizens. notuntil

bycosimos banker allies. the republicsurvived inname only.cosimo held thestrings. while heworked behind the scenes togain control, however, publicly cosimo presentedanother picture. when hewalked through the streets of florence, hedressed modestly,was attended byno more than one ser- vant, and bowed deferentiallytomagistratesand elder citizens. herode a mule instead ofahorse. he never spokeout onmatters ofpublic import, even though hecontrolled florences foreign affairs for over thirty years. hegave moneytocharities andmaintained histies toflorences merchant class. hefinanced allldnds

finallydied in1464, after rulingforyears.the citizens offlorence wanted tobuild him agreat tomb, and tocelebrate hismemory with elaborate funeral ceremonies, but onhisdeathbed hehad asked tobe buried without any pompordemonstration. some sixty years later, machiavelli hailed cosimo asthewisest ofallprinces, for heknew how extraordinary thingsthat are seen andappear every hour make men much more

spartans,theathenians respondedtoevery problem with consummate creativity, adaptingtotheoccasion andcreatingnew social forms and new arts atanincrediblepace.their societywas inconstant flux. and astheir power grew, theycame toposeathreat tothedefense-minded spartans. in4-31 b.c., the war that had been brewing between athens andsparta for solong finally erupted.itlastedtwentyseven years, but

nationalists, lead by chiang kai-shek, decided the time had come toannihilate thechinese communists, their hated rivals, once and forall.theyhad almost suc- ceeded in1935, forcing thecommunists into thelong march, thegrueling retreat that hadgreatlydiminished their numbers. although thecommu nists had recovered somewhat during the waragainst japan,itwould not bedifficult todefeat them now. theycontrolled only isolated areas inthe countryside,had unsophisticated weaponry,lackedanymilitary experi- ence ortraining beyondmountain fighting,and controlled noimportant partsofchina, exceptareas ofmanchutia, which theyhadmanagedtotake after thejapaneseretreat. chiang decided tocommit hisbest forces in manclmria. hewould take over itsmajorcities andfrom those bases would spread through thisnorthern industrial region, sweepingthecommunists away.once manchuria had fallen thecommunists would collapse. in1945 and 46theplan worked perfectly:the nationalists easily took themajor manchurian cities. puzzlingly, though,intheface ofthis critical campaign, thecommunist strategy made no sense. when thena- tionalists began their push, thecommunists dispersed tomanchurias most out-ofthe-waycorners. their small units harassed thenationalist armies, ambushing them here, retreating unexpectedly there, but these dispersed units never linkedup,makingthem hard toattack. they would seize a town onlytogive itupafew weeks later. forming neither rearguardsi101 vanguards, theymoved likemercury,never staying inoneplace,elusive and formless. the nationalists ascribed this
